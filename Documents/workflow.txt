Main périphériques:
	Motors(moving), Micros(whistle), TOF(obstacles)

		Sub tasks:
			- Figure out how to calculate the position

		MAIN TASK: GET THE DOG TO GO IN A LOOP
		AND AVOID OBSTACLES
		
		Sub tasks:
			- Figure out TOF and make the robot stop
			moving when he sees something
			- Create a basic print library to easily
			print information to RealTerm
			- Create basic motors library with basic
			functions turn and move
			- Create a loop thread that makes the robot
			move in a square loop
			- Create TOF thread that will stop the motors
			when an object is seen and continue the loop
			when object is removed
			- Improve TOF loop so that it can go around
			a simple obstacle
