Scripts to plot what is sent by the camera in TP4 or the FFT in TP5 instead of using Matlab.
The bluetooth should work as well as the USB, except for the connection time 
(but depends on the bluetooth dongle/chip used by the computer).



You have two possibilities to use the scripts :



1) By installing Python3 and running the scripts
 	-Install python3 (Check "pip" and "Add Python to environment variables" if asked during the installation process)
   
	-(for Windows) Type « pip install pyserial» and « pip install matplotlib » in a command line window
	-(for Mac) Type « pip3 install pyserial» and « pip3 install matplotlib » in a terminal window  
	-Run the script plotFFT.py or plotImage.py in the terminal and give to it the com port as argument

	 exemple : « python path_to_the_script\plotFFT.py comX » (for Windows)
	 or      : « python3 path_to_the_script/plotFFT.py /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX » (for Mac)



2) By executing a precompiled version (only for Windows 64bits) :
   
	-Go into the folder precompiled_for_windows_64bits
   
	-Edit the file WRITE_INSIDE_THE_PORT_TO_USE.txt to tell which com port to use
   
	-Execute plotFFT.exe or plotImage.exe depending on the script you want 

Troubleshooting :
If you get a lot of Timeout messages in the terminal while trying to receive something from the e-puck2, quit the program, unplug the USB cable (or disable the bluetooth if used instead of the USB), shutdown the epuck2 and retry.
